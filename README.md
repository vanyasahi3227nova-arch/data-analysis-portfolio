Project #01: Generative AI & Intellectual Property Rights

Data Science Project | TECH 3100 – Introduction to Data Sciences

📌 Project Overview

This project investigates the prevalence of copyrighted material within the training data of Large Language Models (LLMs) and explores how copyright status varies across time and data source domains. As generative AI systems rely on massive corpora of text, this study addresses a critical question at the intersection of data science, ethics, and law: to what extent are LLM training datasets composed of copyrighted versus open-licensed content? 

Project Idea Proposal-Data Scie…

🎯 Research Objectives

Quantify the proportion of copyrighted vs. open-licensed tokens in representative LLM training corpora

Analyze trends over time (2012–2025) in the use of copyrighted material

Compare copyright prevalence across source domains (e.g., books, blogs, forums, academic articles)

Evaluate how different labeling heuristics (conservative vs. liberal) affect copyright classification

Assess implications for responsible AI development and policy governance 

Project Idea Proposal-Data Scie…

🧠 Research Questions & Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis (H₀): ≤ 50% of tokens in a representative LLM training corpus originate from copyrighted sources
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): > 50% of tokens in a representative LLM training corpus originate from copyrighted sources 

Project Idea Proposal-Data Scie…

📊 Methodology

This study adopts a quantitative and inferential data science approach, incorporating:

Secondary data analysis of publicly documented LLM training datasets

Token-level copyright classification using heuristic labeling strategies

Time-series analysis to identify longitudinal trends

Logistic regression models to evaluate the likelihood of copyright presence across domains

The methodology follows a structured scientific process, including hypothesis formulation, statistical testing, troubleshooting, and result interpretation.

🛠 Tools & Techniques

Python (data cleaning, statistical analysis, modeling)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Logistic Regression

Data visualization (trend and domain comparisons)

Academic and legal literature review

🌍 Significance & Impact

This project contributes to ongoing global discussions around:

Transparency in AI training data

Ethical use of copyrighted materials

Governance and regulation of generative AI systems

The findings aim to inform policymakers, researchers, and AI developers on balancing innovation with intellectual property protections in the generative AI era.
